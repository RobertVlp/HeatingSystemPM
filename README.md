# PID Controlled Heating System

This project involves creating a heating system that use Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control. A target temperature can be set using an encoder, and the system's function is to maintain the chosen temperature. The temperature is measured using a sensor and a thermocouple. The data is shown on an LCD screen in real time.

## Key Features:
  * PID Control: The system uses a PID algorithm to adjust the heating power based on the difference between the current temperature and the desired temperature, ensuring energy efficiency and temperature precision.
  * Temperature Setting: Users can select the target temperature using buttons, and the system will attempt to maintain the temperature at that value.
  * Real-time Monitoring: Data about the current and set temperatures are displayed in real-time on an LCD display, allowing users to monitor the system and make adjustments if necessary.

## Advantages and Applications:
  * Energy Efficiency: PID control automatically adjusts the heating power to minimize energy consumption, contributing to the system's efficiency.
  * Temperature Precision: The system maintains the temperature as close as possible to the desired value, reducing fluctuations and ensuring a stable and comfortable environment.
  * Practical Applications: The project has practical applications in areas such as temperature control in incubators, HVAC systems, or laboratory devices that require a constant thermal environment.
